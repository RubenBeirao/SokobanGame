# SokobanGame

Project developed during the second year of my degree in the scope of Oriented Object Programming discipline.

The final work consists of creating a game of the type known as Transport Puzzle (this variant in particular is known as Sokoban ). The main characteristics of this type of games are:
● It is a strategy game.
● The character controlled by the user (in this case a forklift) makes a move each time in one of four possible directions. The goal is to arrange a set of boxes in predefined locations (marked with "X"), pushing them and preventing them from staying in positions from which it is not possible to remove them. The player can only push a crate of each time.
● Normally, when you finish tidying in one level of the game, you move on to a new level that has a slightly more difficult problem. Solutions are valued with the smallest number of forklift movements.
